            <p>Good morning. My name is Bonhommer Antoine. I am 19 years old, I am an Haitian. I live in Haiti, more precisely in Petit-Goave. I am a musician, I play guitar, piano and flute. I am also a great football and volleyball player. 
                I have to leave Haiti one day, to go to USA if God wills. There, i'll be able to work and make more money. I hope I'll play soccer or volleyball there also. <br>If I'll have this chance, I'll be like Messi is; humble, talented, and successed.
                I have a great friend. I love her so much. When I am with her, I am very happy, I just focus on her, forgetting anything else. She's so beautiful. May God protect her.
                If you want to know more about me, contact me by WhatsApp on (509) 37648061</p>

            <p>Haiti is a great country, only because of its climat. And for its foods, and its beaches. The image above is a picture of me, in my church in Haiti. It was a sunday, I went to church with my family.</p>
